# 🚗 Polynomial Regression and Regularization in Used Car Pricing
![Polynomial Regression and Regularization in Used Car Pricing](image.png)

## 🌐 Overview
In this project, we delve into a dataset of used car prices from CarDekho, aiming to accurately estimate a car's price based on its features. Through meticulous analysis and preprocessing of the data, we apply polynomial regression to enhance our model's performance. Emphasizing its potency in modeling non-linear relationships, polynomial regression is paired with regularization techniques to counteract overfitting. To round off, we discuss the foundational assumptions of our approach, including linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality.

## 🚩 Problem
Estimating used car prices is a challenging endeavor. Factors such as make, age, mileage, and overall condition significantly influence a car's value. In this project, we leverage polynomial regression and regularization to enhance the accuracy of our estimations, providing potential sellers and buyers with a more precise price point.

## 🎯 Objectives
- **Data Analysis and Preprocessing**: Scrutinize the dataset and prepare it for modeling.
- **Model Building**: Construct various regression models to predict used car prices:
  - Linear Regression
  - Polynomial Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Elastic-Net Regression

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset provides a comprehensive view of used car details. Each feature of the dataset is described in the table below:
